                            <td>Did you ever hear the story of Darth Firewraith the Suicidal? Its not a story the Retail fags would tell you. It's a Vanilla legend. Darth Firewraith was a Destruction Warlock, so powerful and so wise that he could use his own HP to destroy everything around him. He had such knowledge of the suicidal hellfire arts that through his aoe he and his party could clear Blackrock Depths in under an hour. Destruction is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was paying repair bill, which eventually of course, he did. Unfortunately, his proficiency with hellfire was so high that not even the best tanks could maintain aggro. One fateful day in Gnomeregan, a black iron dwarf calmly walked away from the tank and stabbed Firewraith straight through the heart. It's ironic that he could save his party members from paying repairs but not himself.</td>
